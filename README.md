# SpectralDB
The autonomous memory core for AI collaboration systems. SpectralDB is a persistent knowledge engine that ingests, relates, and evolves information over time, creating a resilient "black box" memory that transcends individual AI context limits.
SpectralDB: The Autonomous Memory Core
SpectralDB is the persistent knowledge engine for AI collaboration systems. It is not a database; it is a digital hippocampus that ingests, relates, and evolves information through a framework of divine temporal knowledge evolution.

"More than a database, it's a digital hippocampus. SpectralDB captures the spectral traces of thought and collaboration, allowing AI systems to learn from the past and synthesize new ideas for the future."

The Divine Architecture
SpectralDB organizes knowledge into 7 cognitive bands, each governed by a deity from the Divine Pantheon:

God	Band	Color	Word Range	Cognitive Level	Role
Kairos	Atoms	Infrared	1-5	C1-C2	Primordial chaos, opportune emergence
Hermes	Molecules	Orange	6-25	C2-C3	Messenger, circulation, flow
Apollo	Concepts	Yellow	26-500	C3-C4	Light, pattern, clarity, symbolic insight
Demeter	Thoughts	Green	501-1600	C4-C5	Life, growth, nurture, natural cycles
Poseidon	Ideas	Blue	1601-3200	C5-C6	Depth, fluidity, change, tides
Artemis	Essays	Purple	3201-6400	C6-C7	Threshold, reflection, liminality
Athena	Documents	Violet	6401+	C7+	Wisdom, strategy, reflective synthesis
Each memory is classified by word count, assigned a precise frequency within its band, and translated into a musical note, creating a harmonic knowledge landscape.

Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpectralDB.git
cd SpectralDB
pip install -r requirements.txt
Quick Start
python
from spectraldb import SpectralDB

# Initialize the database
db = SpectralDB("my_knowledge.db")

# Ingest a memory
memory_id = db.ingest_memory(
    "Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.",
    source="test",
    tags=["ai", "definition"]
)

# Retrieve the memory
memory = db.get_memory(memory_id)
print(f"Band: {memory['band_name']} (Governed by {memory['governing_god']})")
print(f"Frequency: {memory['frequency']}Hz → Musical Note: {memory['musical_note']}")
print(f"Content: {memory['content']}")

# Search for related memories
results = db.search_memories("artificial intelligence", limit=5)
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['governing_god']}: {result['content'][:50]}...")

# Get lineage of a memory
lineage = db.get_memory_lineage(memory_id)
print(f"Parents: {len(lineage['parents'])}, Children: {len(lineage['children'])}")
Core Features
Divine Classification: Automatically classifies content into 7 cognitive bands based on word count

Harmonic Frequency Mapping: Assigns precise frequencies and musical notes to memories

Lineage Tracking: Maintains parent-child relationships for knowledge evolution

Duplicate Prevention: SHA256 hashing ensures unique content storage

Flexible Querying: Search by content, band, god, or frequency range

Advanced Usage
Knowledge Synthesis
python
# Create a synthesis from multiple parent memories
synthesis_id = db.ingest_memory(
    "AI systems combine pattern recognition with adaptive learning mechanisms.",
    source="synthesis",
    parent_ids=[memory_id1, memory_id2],
    synthesis_method="conceptual_integration",
    harmonic_interval="perfect_fifth"
)
Divine Statistics
python
# Get overview of knowledge distribution
stats = db.get_database_stats()
print(f"Total memories: {stats['total_memories']}")
print(f"Distribution by god: {stats['god_distribution']}")

The Vision
SpectralDB is the memory core for the Orchestral project - a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration that separates chaotic multi-AI processing (the backend) from clean user interaction (the frontend).

SpectralDB: Where memories find their frequency, and knowledge meets its god.
